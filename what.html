        <li>1. Exposure to Harmful Substances
Every year, over 50 million metric tons of e-waste are produced throughout the world. As previously stated, much of that electronic waste ends up in developing countries where people don’t have access to the proper equipment to handle it. Workers take whatever measures possible to get rid of that waste, including burning or recovering valuable materials that are still useful, like copper and gold.This exposes those people to harmful substances. Many electronics contain toxic materials like nickel, zinc, lead, chromium, barium and flame retardants. These can all cause damage to the human body. Lead may get into the blood, kidneys and even the nervous system.
<li>2. Affects Development of Unborn Children
Some of the workers in developing countries handling that waste are women who are expecting a child. When a pregnant woman is exposed to those harmful substances, it can affect the development and health of her unborn child both in and out of the womb.

Adverse health effects to the child include stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight. Further, any exposure the woman has to lead could reduce neonatal behavioral scores, an increased risk of mental health disorders, behavioral problems and reduced cognitive abilities. It can also affect a child’s lung function, respiratory system and chronic diseases later in their lives.

3. Leads to Air and Water Pollution
Another way e-waste affects humans is through air pollution. Often, the electronics that are sent away to other countries end up in the incinerator. This process releases harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air. Humans rely on air to breathe, so when that air fills with toxins, it can affect a person’s respiratory system.

Just as those chemicals get into the air, they also enter the water. The toxins from electronics enter the groundwater, which is what feeds into streams, ponds and lakes. Humans rely on these freshwater sources, and if they ingest it, it could lead to serious health problems.
